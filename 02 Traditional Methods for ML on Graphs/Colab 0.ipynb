What we want to learn is a function $f \\to \\mathcal{V} \\times \\mathcal{R}^d$, a function that takes in a node and its feature vector, as well as the graph structure, and outputs an _embedding_, a vector that represents that node in a way that's useful to our downstream task. Once we've mapped nodes and their initial features to their learned embeddings, we can use those embeddings to do a variety of different tasks including node-level, edge-level, or graph-level regression/classification.\n","\n","In this colab, we want to learn embeddings that will be useful to classify each node into its community.\n","\n","With this, we are ready to create our first Graph Neural Network by defining our network architecture in a `torch.nn.Module` class:"],"metadata":{"id":"DXxS9ZANzQnU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import torch\n","from torch.nn import Linear\n","from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv\n","\n","class GCN(torch.nn.Module):\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    super(GCN, self).__init__()\n","    torch.manual_seed(960708)\n","    self.classifier = Linear(2, dataset.num_classes)\n","\n","    self.convs = torch.nn.ModuleList()\n","\n","    self.convs.append(GCNConv(input_dim, hidden_dim))\n","    for i in range(num_layers-1):\n","      self.convs.append(GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim))\n","    \n","    self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()\n","\n","  def forward(self, x, edge_index):\n","    for i in range(num_layers):\n","      x = self.convs[i](x, edge_index)\n","      x = x.tanh()\n","\n","      # h = self.relu(h)\n","      h = torch.nn.functional.relu(h)\n","      h = torch.nn.functional.dropout(h, dropout=0.5, training=self.training)\n","      h = self.conv3(h, edge_index)\n","      embeddings = h.tanh() # Final GNN embedding space.\n","\n","      # Apply a final (linear) classifier\n","      out = self.classifier(embeddings)\n","\n","      return out, embeddings\n","model = GCN()\n","print(model)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":358},"id":"CRSUXHiGzbY2","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1645288462932,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":289,"user":{"displayName":"김혜지","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggz_fcar1vxv-RBwrfBeTxC-T-Yfs9Ye93bTzbx=s64","userId":"05141025162228592763"}},"outputId":"4883236a-b7fb-4091-e8fc-687fb058ffe0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-31-707a83f40379>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     32\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     33\u001b[0m       \u001b[0;32mreturn\u001b[0m \u001b[0mout\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0membeddings\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 34\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mGCN\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     35\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-31-707a83f40379>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m__init__\u001b[0;34m(self)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     11\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mconvs\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtorch\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnn\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mModuleList\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     12\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 13\u001b[0;31m     \u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mconvs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mappend\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mGCNConv\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0minput_dim\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mhidden_dim\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     14\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mi\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mrange\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnum_layers\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     15\u001b[0m       \u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mconvs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mappend\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mGCNConv\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mhidden_dim\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mhidden_dim\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'input_dim' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here, we first initialize all of our building blocks in `__init__` and define the computation flow of our network in `forward`.\n","We first define and stack **three graph convolution layers**.
